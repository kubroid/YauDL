V1.00:
------

(1)	Don't populate C5. It interferes with the cable tie.

(2)	Make sure the 'I_SET' jumper is 100% FLUSH on the bottom
	of the circuit board, so it doesn't interfere with the
	battery. Add 1 layer of tesa-strip around the battery for
	additional insulation in that area.

(3)	TS2940CW50 - voltage regulator unstable _again_
	
	Change LED resistor (RLED1) to allow for 10mA of current.

(4)	The BZX84C-5V1 Zener diodes open too early and clip at
	about 4.50V instead of slightly above 5V. This limits the
	usable input voltage range to about 0-18V-ish. They should
	be replaced with 5V6 ones. The input-protection diodes of
	a 5V tolerant microcontroller should do the rest.


V0.1:
-----

(6)	Replace the MOSFET based RPP with a single Schottky Diode:
	MBR1045 - TO-220 package. 45V, 10A. Forward voltage of 
	0.5V at 5A --> 2.5W. Should survive without a large HS.


(5)	If you require high current with input voltages below 5V,
	the reverse polarity protection tends to heat up a lot.

	DON'T populate: Q3, Q4, R7, DZ1

	Place a 2mm jumper wire between JP1 and JP2 to override.
	This will avoid the magic blue smoke.


(4)	Added 2x 47ÂµF electrolytic capacitors across the DUT
	terminals (back to back --> non polarized).


(3)	TS2940CW50 - Voltage regulator unstable.

	Change LED resistor to 470Ohm to draw more current.
	This removes all output voltage oscillations.	


(2)	TS2940CW50 - Voltage regulator unstable.

	C1 and C2 MUST be tantalum capacitors!	


(1)	TS2940CW50 - Voltage regulator unstable.

	Don't populate C2 (output capacitor).
	
	The datasheet mentions a minimum load of 10mA for the thing
	to be stable. I couldn't get rid of massive output voltage oscillations
	as long as C2 was populated, although I added a 100Ohm resistor to
	draw about 50mA. Tried a different regulator, different cap as well.
	I've never experienced such misbehaviour before. It worked just fine
	in previous projects...
