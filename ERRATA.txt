V0.1:
-----

(6)	Instead of (5) add a 3V lithium cell to pull the gates
	of the P-CH mosfets to -3V.

	Cut the connection of R7 to GNDPWR and connect that end
	of R7 to (-) of the cell. Connect (+) of the cell to
	GNDPWR.


(5)	If you require high current with input voltages below 5V,
	the reverse polarity protection tends to heat up a lot.

	DON'T populate: Q3, Q4, R7, DZ1

	Place a 2mm jumper wire between JP1 and JP2 to override.
	This will avoid the magic blue smoke.


(4)	Added 2x 47ÂµF electrolytic capacitors across the DUT
	terminals (back to back --> non polarized).


(3)	TS2940CW50 - Voltage regulator unstable.

	Change LED resistor to 470Ohm to draw more current.
	This removes all output voltage oscillations.	


(2)	TS2940CW50 - Voltage regulator unstable.

	C1 and C2 MUST be tantalum capacitors!	


(1)	TS2940CW50 - Voltage regulator unstable.

	Don't populate C2 (output capacitor).
	
	The datasheet mentions a minimum load of 10mA for the thing
	to be stable. I couldn't get rid of massive output voltage oscillations
	as long as C2 was populated, although I added a 100Ohm resistor to
	draw about 50mA. Tried a different regulator, different cap as well.
	I've never experienced such misbehaviour before. It worked just fine
	in previous projects...
